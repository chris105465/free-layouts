# Free Lioden Layouts
This repository was made for the purpose of storing all of my free stylesheets for use on Lioden. All layouts are subject to the rules laid out on [my thread on the site](https://www.lioden.com/topic.php?id=304429491963). Due to continuing issues with dropbox, I have decided to move my free work here and store all future layouts on GitHub as well.

## Personal Folder Exception
I have also included a personal folder for anything to do with my own layouts. The location of these may change in the future (such as a separate reository) and are not free for use, so they are not to be edited in the same way as my free layouts.
