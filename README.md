# Lioden Layouts
This repository was made for the purpose of storing all of my stylesheets for use on Lioden. Anything in the main css folder is one of my free layouts. All free layouts are subject to the rules laid out on [my thread on the site](https://www.lioden.com/topic.php?id=304429491963). Due to continuing issues with dropbox, I have decided to move my work here and store all future layouts on GitHub as well.

## Personal and Comms Folder
These folders are for my personal layouts and my commission work. I ask that the layouts in these folders not be edited by anyone but me or used by anyone except the commissioner.
